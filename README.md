# Lexicon-Test
This project from Lexicon i Väst was to evaluate the programming skills before Programming .NET course.

Programming Preparatory course
I want you to create a simpler program with the following features. Suggested in a console project in Visual Studio.
The program must consist of a menu system where you can use input to select which functionality to run. The program should be kept running until you select the option to close it (preferably with the option 0 in the menu).
I want these features:
1. Function that prints "Hello World" in the console
Function that takes input from the user (First name, Last name, Age) and then prints these in the console
3. Function that changes the color of the text in the console (and changes back if you use the function again
4. Function for printing today's date
5. Function that takes two input values, then prints which of them is the largest.
6. Function that generates that random number between 1 and 100. The user should then guess the number. If the user guesses correctly, a message should say this, as well as how many attempts it took. If the user guesses incorrectly, a message should be displayed informing if the number was too large or too small
7. Function where the user enters a line of text, which is then saved in a file on the hard disk
8. Function where a file is loaded from the hard disk (for the sake of simplicity, you can use the file from task 7)
9. Function where the user submits a decimal number and gets the root back out, raised to 2 and raised to 10
10. Function where the program prints a multiplication table from 1 to 10. A "tab" must be entered after each number. Try to set it up so it becomes relatively readable.
11. Function that creates two arrays. The first is filled with random numbers. The second is filled with the numbers from the first in ascending order.
12. Function that takes an input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome (ie the same word from both sides, such as Anna or radar.
13. Function that takes two inputs from the user and then prints all numbers that are between the two inputs.
14. Function where the user submits a number of values ​​(comma-separated numbers) which are then sorted and printed according to odd and even values.
15. Function where the user enters a number of values ​​(comma-separated digits) which are then added and printed.
16. Function where the user must enter the name of his character and the name of an opponent. The function must then itself add random values ​​for Health, Strength and Luck, which are saved in an instance of a class.

Good luck!
